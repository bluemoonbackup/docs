            <p>
              This enables Cloud Backup to back up files that are currently
              in-use. It also provides disk-wide &quot;crash-consistency&quot;,
              as all files for backup will originate from the precisely same

            </p>
            <p>
              Non-Windows platforms do not currently require the use of this
              feature to back up in-use files, however, they also do not benefit
              from the disk-wide consistency.

              Windows supports taking VSS snapshots of <code>NTFS</code> and

              Cloud Backup supports backing up Windows network shares (SMB /
              CIFS). However, you should prefer to install Cloud Backup directly
              on the network device; this will offer increased backup
              performance.

                The &quot;Choose Items&quot; dialog lets you browse through
                mapped network drive letters. You can also use the &quot;Options
                &gt; Browse UNC Path&quot; option to directly browse a UNC path.

              <li>
                Cloud Backup supports entering custom Windows Network
                Authentication credentials via the &quot;Log in to network
                share&quot; option. If you select a network share for backup,
                you may need to enter custom credentials in order for the
                service user account to access the network share.
              </li>
              <li>
                Because mapped network drives are private to a user session,
                Cloud Backup automatically converts mapped network drive letters
                into their UNC path equivalent, so that it can still be accessed
                by the service user account.

              EFS is a Windows feature that allows you to encrypt individual
              files on disk. Cloud Backup supports backing up EFS-encrypted
              files on Windows. The files will be silently decrypted if possible
              (e.g. if Cloud Backup is running as the encryption user, or if
              Cloud Backup is running as the EFS Recovery Agent user).
            </p>
            <p>
              If it is not possible to automatically decrypt the file for
              backup, Cloud Backup will back up the file in its encrypted form,
              and will only be able to restore it in its encrypted form.
              EFS-encrypted files are displayed with green text in the Restore
              browser dialog in Cloud Backup.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have a PC failure, the EFS encryption keys may be lost. In
              this situation, the EFS-encrypted files may be unusable, even
              after restoring from backup. Cloud Backup warns you about this
              situation by adding a warning message in the backup job log.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to safely prepare for this scenario, you should export
              the PC's EFS encryption keys, so that the files can be accessed
              after a PC failure. On Windows, you can do this via
              <code>certmgr.msc</code>; or on Windows Server, taking a System
              State backup may be sufficient.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you have safely backed up the PC's EFS encryption keys, you
              can suppress the warning in Cloud Backup by enabling the &quot;I
              confirm EFS keys are exported&quot; option in the Protected Item
              settings.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have only a partial PC failure (e.g. files lost, but OS
              installation and user accounts remain intact) the EFS-encrypted
              files will be restorable without any further attention to the EFS
              keys.

              Windows Server 2012 and later have a data deduplication feature
              that is separate- and unrelated- to Cloud Backup's own
              deduplication, that can be used to increase free disk space on
              NTFS volumes. A scanning process runs in the background to find
              and merge duplicate file content. By default, the scanning process
              runs overnight.
            </p>
            <p>
              Deduplicated files look and behave like normal files; however,
              they are stored on disk in a special format, that can only be read
              by Windows Server (and Linux). Non-Server versions of Windows are
              entirely unable to read these files from disk.
            </p>
            <p>
              When backing up deduplicated files with Cloud Backup, it backs up
              the full (rehydrated) file content, and then applies its own
              deduplication to it. This means that Windows Server deduplicated
              files can be safely restored to non-Server versions of Windows.
            </p>
            <p>
              When restoring deduplicated files from Cloud Backup, the files are
              restored in their full (rehydrated) format, and are not
              re-deduplicated until Windows runs its next background scanning
              pass. This means that you may not have enough free disk space to
              completely restore a backup to the same source drive.

              Cloud Backup can exclude files based on a regular expression
              (regex). Any files matching the regular expression will be
              excluded from the backup job. The specific syntax flavour is that
              of the
              <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/#hdr-Syntax"
                >Go regexp library</a
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              The regular expression is tested against the full disk path to the
              file. This enables filtering by path component, or (on Windows)
              drive letter.
            </p>
            <p>By default, the regular expression is</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                case-sensitive. You can perform a case-insensitive match by
                adding an <code>(?i)</code> expression
              </li>
              <li>
                non-anchored. You can restrict your regex to the start- or end-
                of the file path by using the <code>^</code>, <code>$</code>,
                <code>\A</code> and/or <code>\z</code> expressions.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Forwardslash (<code>/</code>) is not a special character and does
              not require escaping with <code>\/</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              An invalid regular expression will prevent a backup job from
              running.

            <p>
              In a regular &quot;Files and Folders&quot; backup, Cloud Backup
              will skip over files that have the same file size and modification
              time as the last backup job. If these properties are the same,
              Cloud Backup will refer to previous chunks and not re-chunk the
              file. This dramatically improves performance.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are working with certain types of files that change content
              without updating their modification time attribute on the
              filesystem - for instance, applications that use direct disk I/O
              instead of filesystem functions; some database data files; or
              VeraCrypt container files - then the above is obviously
              unsatisfactory for ensuring backup integrity. In this case, you
              can enable the &quot;Rescan unchanged files&quot; feature to cause
              Cloud Backup to chunk every encountered file. This has some
              performance penalty but does ensure backup integrity in the
              presence of such files.

            </h2>
            <p>
              The &quot;Program Output&quot; backup type backs up the
              <code>stdout</code> (Standard Output) stream of any command
              execution. This stream data is saved as a virtual file within the
              backup job. You can choose the virtual file name.
            </p>
            <p>
              The data is streamed directly to the backup destination and never
              touches the local disk. This has the consequence that no progress
              bar or ETA can be calculated or displayed during backup jobs.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the target application produces any content on
              <code>stderr</code> (Standard Error), it will be logged in the job
              report, and the final job status will not be less severe than
              &quot;Warning&quot;.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the target application exits with a non-zero error code, the
              error code will be logged in the job report, and the final job
              status will not be less severe than &quot;Error&quot;.

              This Protected Item type backs up Microsoft Exchange Server
              databases. The underlying technology is <code>VSS</code> and is
              compatible with Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 and later,
              including Exchange Server 2016 (the latest version at the time of
              writing).
            </p>
            <p>The appropriate VSS writer must be installed.</p>
            <p>
              As Exchange Server can only be installed on Server SKUs of
              Windows, this backup type is only applicable when running on
              Windows Server.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some forms of Exchange Server backup will cause log truncation to
              occur on the Exchange Server. For more information, please see the
              official Exchange Server documentation. If circular logging is
              enabled on the Exchange Server, the 'Incremental' and
              'Differential' backup types have limited effect.

              When backing up a guest VM, it's important to get a consistent
              state of the VM. There are some different ways this happens.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the guest OS has all necessary Hyper-V integration services
              installed, then the host can request for the guest VM to take a
              VSS snapshot. The snapshot is then exposed to Hyper-V on the host
              for Cloud Backup to back up. It shouldn't interrupt the guest OS.
              The VM backup is application-consistent. This is known as a
              &quot;Production checkpoint&quot;.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the host OS is running Server 2012 R2 or newer, but there are
              no integration services inside the guest OS, then Hyper-V will
              take a checkpoint of the VM; Cloud Backup will back up the
              checkpoint; and then the checkpoint will be removed. This kind of
              checkpoint does not interrupt the guest OS. The VM backup is
              crash-consistent. This is known as a &quot;Standard
              checkpoint&quot;.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                You can also achieve this behavior by disabling &quot;Production
                checkpoints&quot; in the Hyper-V settings for the VM.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If the host OS is older than Server 2012 R2, and there are no
              integration services inside the guest OS, then the VM will be
              paused; Windows will take a VSS snapshot of Hyper-V's files in
              paused state; the VM will be resumed and Cloud Backup will back up
              from the VSS snapshot. It would cause a short interruption to the
              guest OS. The VM backup is crash-consistent.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                You can also achieve this behavior by disabling checkpoints in
                the Hyper-V settings for the VM.

              If you are using Hyper-V replication, you can back up your virtual
              machines from either the primary or replica host.
            </p>
            <p>
              A backup taken on the primary VM host is application-consistent
              (if possible), by quiescing a VSS snapshot inside the VM guest; or
              crash-consistent otherwise. However, a backup taken on the
              secondary VM host is only ever crash-consistent, because the
              replica VM is not running in order for guest integration services
              to take a VSS snapshot.
            </p>
            <p>
              Current versions of Hyper-V do not allow backing up a VM that is
              currently replicating. If a VM is found to be currently
              replicating at the time of backup, Cloud Backup will retry the
              operation a few times. If you repeatedly see errors of the form
              <code
                >The virtual machine '...' cannot start a backup operation
                because it is currently executing a conflicting operation. Try
                the backup again.</code
              >, and you are running backups from the replica VM host, you could
              consider
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                scheduling the backup job to run at a time when it's more likely
                that the VM replication is up-to-date; or
              </li>
              <li>
                using Before / After commands in Cloud Backup to temporarily
                stop VM replication while the backup job is running.

              Hyper-V supports passthrough disks, to attach a physical disk from
              the host directly into the guest VM. This unmounts it from the
              host OS.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hyper-V itself does not support backing up passthrough disks (nor
              does it support replicating them). A Hyper-V backup of the guest
              machines can be taken from the host, but does not include any data
              from passthrough disks.
            </p>
            <p>You can work around this issue by either</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                installing Cloud Backup inside the guest VM, and backing up the
                extra data at a file level (this will use an extra Device
                license); or
              </li>
              <li>
                changing your passthrough disks to be a real disk containing a
                large <code>.vhd</code> or <code>.vhdx</code> file. The
                &quot;New Virtual Disk Wizard&quot; in Hyper-V Manager has an
                option to convert an existing disk to a <code>.vhd</code> or
                <code>.vhdx</code> file.
              </li>

              The address is always <code>localhost</code>, but Cloud Backup
              does not use TCP addresses or TCP ports to connect to SQL Server
              instances. Cloud Backup uses &quot;Shared Memory&quot; to connect
              to SQL Server instances.

            <p>
              Cloud Backup's use of &quot;Shared Memory&quot; connection does
              improves performance for some operations, at the expense of only
              working on the local machine; but Cloud Backup's use of VDI
              requires it to run against the local machine anyway.

              If you encounter issues connecting to your SQL Server, you must

              Cloud Backup supports backing up multiple instances from SQL
              Server. You can select an instance for backup, by entering the
              instance name in the &quot;Instance Name&quot; field. Leave this
              field blank to use the default instance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cloud Backup automatically lists available instances for selection

              By default, Cloud Backup opts to make a full database export from
              SQL Server, and then uses its own deduplication system to optimise
              the stored/uploaded data.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is the &quot;Full (copy only)&quot; option. It is equivalent
              to the <code>BACKUP WITH COPY_ONLY</code> T-SQL statement.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because Cloud Backup can efficiently deduplicate full image
              backups, it is normally sufficient to only take full backups of
              SQL Server in Cloud Backup.

              You have the option to use SQL Server's own differential/log
              backup system. This may be more efficient, but it does require
              additional administrative work, and complicates the process of
              restoring data.
            </p>
            <p>
              The SQL Server maintains one single point-in-time reference, from
              which it can produce differential backups and/or log-based
              backups. When you take a new &quot;Full (base image)&quot; backup,
              the point-in-time reference is moved forward, so that any future
              differential and/or log-based backups are based on the last
              base-image backup.
            </p>
            <p>
              To use SQL Server's own differential/log backup system, you must
              create multiple Protected Items (each with a different schedule)
              in order to capture both a base image and a differential/log
              backups. By creating multiple Protected Items, you can
              individually schedule, report-on, and manage retention policies
              for both base and differential/log backups.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are using Cloud Backup alongside another product for SQL
              server backups, you should ensure that only one product is taking
              base-image backups. Otherwise, it's possible that a chain of
              differential/log backups would be incomplete.

              Cloud Backup can use SQL Server's own systems for differential
              backup. In this mode, you can regularly make &quot;differential
              base&quot; backups, and then a series of small &quot;differential
              increment&quot; backups, each containing the difference from the
              last base backup. These operations are equivalent to the
              <code>BACKUP</code> and
              <code>BACKUP WITH DIFFERENTIAL</code> T-SQL statements
              respectively. Cloud Backup will still deduplicate multiple base
              backups that are sent to the same Storage Vault.

              You can opt to use SQL Server's own systems for log backup. In

              and regularly take log backups.
            </p>
            <p>
              You have the choice of whether to apply log truncation. These
              operations are equivalent to the <code>BACKUP LOG</code> and
              <code>BACKUP LOG WITH NO_TRUNCATE</code> T-SQL statements
              respectively. Cloud Backup will still deduplicate all data that is
              sent to the same Storage Vault.

              You can use the &quot;Application-Aware Writer&quot; type to back
              up SQL Server using the VSS Writer. Compared to Cloud Backup's
              standard VDI approach, this option enables more detailed progress
              information, and can take a consistent point-in-time snapshot of
              multiple databases at once; but offers more limited control over
              SQL Server features such as log truncation. The resulting files
              also must be restored in a different way.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can use Cloud Backup's &quot;Commands&quot; feature to call
              <code>osql</code>/<code>sqlcmd</code> to run a T-SQL
              <code>BACKUP</code> statement against the database, and then back
              up the resulting spooled file with the &quot;Files and
              Folders&quot; type. This option requires more temporary disk space
              than the built-in system above.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can use the &quot;Files and Folders&quot; type to back up
              individual database files if the &quot;Take filesystem
              snapshot&quot; option is selected. However, the &quot;Files and
              Folders&quot; backup type does not invoke SQL Server's VSS writer,
              so this would (at best) produce a &quot;crash-consistent&quot;
              backup and is <em>not recommended</em>.

              MySQL support works at the logical (SQL) level using
              <code>mysqldump</code>. A copy of this program must be found on
              the device in order for the backup job to run.
            </p>
            <p>The <code>mysqldump</code> binary is selected as follows:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If a custom path to <code>mysqldump</code> has been set, this
                binary is used.
              </li>
              <li>
                Otherwise, if there is a version of
                <code>mysqldump</code> installed (e.g. you are backing up a
                MySQL server from the server itself), the local version of
                <code>mysqldump</code> will be used to ensure maximum
                compatibility.
              </li>
              <li>
                Otherwise, if no copy of <code>mysqldump</code> can be found,
                the Windows version of Cloud Backup bundles a recent
                <code>mysqldump</code> binary in compliance with its license.
              </li>
              <li>
                If no suitable <code>mysqldump</code> binary is found, the MySQL
                backup job will fail with an error message
                <code>Couldn't find 'mysqldump' anywhere</code>. This failure
                can be detected via the backup job's status or its log entries.

              On Linux, you can install a copy of <code>mysqldump</code> as

              have special requirements, or if Cloud Backup is unable to
              automatically detect the binary path, you can override the binary
              path to use a custom <code>mongodump</code> and
              <code>mongo</code> shell binary.

              Cloud Backup supports connecting to MongoDB in different ways:

                    Cloud Backup will open an SSH tunnel to the remote server,

                  <li>
                    To use this feature, you should have a

              Cloud Backup can backup a MongoDB replica set with a consistent
              point-in-time snapshot.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cloud Backup can back up a sharded MongoDB cluster, but depending
              on your MongoDB server version, there are some limitations:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                In MongoDB 4.2 and later, the backup may not be point-in-time
                consistent, unless writes are temporarily suspended to the
                MongoDB cluster (e.g. by running custom Before and After
                commands on the Cloud Backup Protected Item configuration).
              </li>
              <li>
                If you are using a variant MongoDB engine (e.g. Amazon
                DocumentDB or Azure CosmosDB), different consistency guarantees
                may apply to sharded backups. You should check with your vendor
                for additional information.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              To back up a sharded cluster in Cloud Backup, enter the
              <code>mongos</code> front-end server in the Cloud Backup
              connection details.
            </p>
            <p>
              When backing up from a <code>mongos</code> server, Cloud Backup
              cannot make use of the &quot;read preference&quot; selection as
              data is proxied through <code>mongos</code>. The backup will read
              from the primary replica set member of each shard replica set.

              Once you restore the <code>.vhd</code> file with Cloud Backup, you
              can use the <code>wbadmin start systemstaterecovery</code> command
              to apply a System State <code>.vhd</code> backup to an installed
              copy of Windows Server.

              Note that because <code>wbadmin</code> is used, spool space is
              required. As an alternative, you can back up System State by using
              the &quot;Application-Aware Writer&quot; Protected Item type. This
              produces a similar result, but

                the files are not collected in a <code>.vhd</code> file. This
                may produce better deduplication at the expense of missing
                bootloader files.

              Cloud Backup integrates with Windows System Backup to support
              backing up entire system volumes as <code>.vhd</code> /

                You can choose a volume by its drive letter (e.g.
                <code>C:\</code>), or by a qualified Windows volume reference
                for volumes without a drive letter (see the output of
                <code>fsutil volume list</code>).

              A local path must be used for spooling temporary data. Spooled

              If you included the OS drive in the backup, it is possible to
              restore the OS to a bootable state, provided some additional
              conditions are met:
            </p>
            <p>
              The following method of restoring the OS requires that you
              included the &quot;System Reserved&quot; partition in the backup
              job; either by manually including the volume, or by choosing
              &quot;All Critical Volumes&quot; in the volume selection.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you do not include the &quot;System Reserved&quot; partition in
              the backup job, the resulting <code>.vhd</code> /
              <code>.vhdx</code> is a data-only file. In that situation you may
              need to manually recreate an NTLDR bootloader (using the
              <code>bootsect</code> and <code>bcdedit</code> commands) before
              the machine can be booted.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are backing up a machine that booted via EFI, you may also
              need to backup and restore the EFI System Partition (ESP).
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that Windows OS installations do specialize themselves for
              the current hardware, and backup images are not automatically
              pre-prepared for hardware independence. An operating system image
              may only boot on identical- or highly-similar hardware. This issue
              originates from the <code>wbadmin</code> &quot;Windows System
              Backup&quot; technology and is not specific to Cloud Backup's
              implementation. You may find more information online.

              VSS is a technology for taking a consistent point-in-time snapshot
              of a disk volume. A VSS Writer is an extra software plugin that
              detects when this action is taking place and ensures that
              application-specific files are in a safe state on disk. Cloud
              Backup's &quot;Application-Aware Writer&quot; feature allows you
              to invoke a single VSS Writer, or a sub-component of a single VSS
              Writer, and back up only the files that it was protecting.

              VSS Writer, you can use this Protected Item type to back it up
              using Cloud Backup.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some products that can be backed up with this Protected Item type

              </li>
              <li>and other products.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>NOTE:</strong> This Protected Item type is intended for
              integration with specific custom applications. If you want to back
              up normal files with a VSS snapshot, use the &quot;Files and
              Folders&quot; Protected Item type with the &quot;take filesystem
              snapshot&quot; option enabled.

              You can select the top-most checkbox to include all components
              within the VSS Writer, or you can select individual components
              within the VSS Writer. For instance, the Microsoft SQL Server VSS
              Writer allows you to select individual databases for backup.

            <p>
              The VSS Writer itself may mark some components as non-selectable.
              This is shown in Cloud Backup as a grey subcomponent without a

              Copy&quot;, &quot;VSS Incremental&quot;, or &quot;VSS
              Differential&quot; modes. If a specific VSS Writer does not
              support the selected backup mode, it will perform the backup in
              &quot;Full&quot; mode.
            </p>
            <p>
              The actual behavior of these modes is specific to each VSS Writer.

              Cloud Backup can back up the contents of any installed VSS Writer
              using the &quot;Application Aware Writer&quot; option. Oracle
              Database officially supports backup via its installed VSS Writer.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may need to install the Oracle VSS Writer separately. It is
              available with Oracle Database 11g and later (including 12c and
              18c); newer versions of the Oracle VSS Writer can be installed
              separately to back up a 10g or 9i database.
            </p>
            <p>
              You should use the &quot;Application Aware Writer&quot; option and
              select the <code>Oracle VSS Writer - ORCL</code> component. Inside
              this option, you can select individual tablespaces for backup, or
              select the entire component.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Oracle VSS Writer reads the database with
              <code>SYSDBA</code> privileges.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Oracle VSS Writer supports log, copy, full, differential, and
              incremental backups:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                if you take &quot;full&quot; or &quot;copy&quot; backups at the
                VSS component, Cloud Backup will deduplicate them together,
                producing its own incremental backups
              </li>
              <li>
                if you take &quot;incremental&quot; backups at the VSS
                component, it may be slightly more space-efficient than Cloud
                Backup's incremental system as Oracle has more specific
                understanding of the file formats. However, when restoring, you
                must take care to restore the full backup and all
                incremental/log backups too, that adds complexity.
              </li>
            </ul>
