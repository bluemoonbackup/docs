              the Cloud Backup client app resets the user's timezone
              automatically, to match the user's operating system timezone. An
              administrator can set the user's timezone to any valid IANA
              <code>tzdata</code> timezone. The default timezone for new
              accounts is always <code>Etc/UTC</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The user's local timezone is used to calculate schedule times
              (e.g. a scheduled backup for &quot;Friday 7 AM&quot; means a
              different UTC instant depending on the customers' configured
              timezone).

              Cloud Backup Server has some built-in features to send email
              reports to customers. You can configure any number of email
              addresses for a user account.
            </p>
            <p>
              Email addresses can be configured via Cloud Backup Server and via
              the Cloud Backup client. An administrator can set an account
              policy to control whether users are allowed to modify their own
              email addresses.

            </p>
            <p>
              You can customize the email reports received by customers.

                  <td>Immediate job notification</td>
                  <td>&gt;= 18.9.3</td>
                  <td>Immediately when a job has completed</td>
                  <td>The report contains the full job log</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Summary table</td>
                  <td>&gt;= 18.9.4</td>

                  <td>A table of jobs matching your custom search</td>
                </tr>

            </table>
            <p>
              Reports can be filtered to choose what jobs will be considered for
              the report. You can filter on a large number of criteria including
              but not limited to the job's type classification, status, start
              time, duration, Protected Item, and Storage Vault. For advanced
              queries, the search system supports boolean logic (AND/OR) and
              arbitrary-depth clause grouping.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can send multiple reports for a single email address. This
              allows you to combine multiple report criteria.
            </p>
            <p>
              For report templates allowing custom schedules, you can use any
              schedule supported by the normal backup scheduler. Scheduled times
              are relative to each customer's configured local timezone.

              You can set a limit on the maximum size of all Protected Items in
              the user's account. When a backup job is performed, the total size
              of Protected Items is checked against this quota, and the backup
              job will be aborted if it would exceed quota. If possible, the
              quota limits are checked before starting the backup, to avoid
              inconvenient interruptions and wasted bandwidth.

              When a schedule is due to run, the backup job will run
              automatically to the selected Storage Vault.
            </p>
            <p>You can also configure advanced backup runtime options:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Skip if already running</strong>. If this option is
                enabled, and another backup job is known by the Cloud Backup
                Server to exist for the same Protected Item and Storage Vault in
                &quot;Running&quot; status, then this backup job will be
                skipped. Skipping a backup job creates a log entry for the job
                in &quot;Skipped&quot; status.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Cancel if still running after</strong>. You can set a
                time limit for the backup job. If the backup job exceeds this
                time limit, the backup job would be cancelled.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Limit Storage Vault Speed</strong>. This option allows
                you to limit the total speed that Cloud Backup reads and writes
                to the Storage Vault. The speed limit applies to the total
                combined read/write bandwidth.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Limit backup to use only 1 disk thread</strong>. When
                reading multiple files from the local disk for backup, Clout
                Backup uses multithreading to improve performance. On some
                machines, this can impact PC performance. If you are
                experiencing low system performance while the backup job is
                running, you can try enabling this option to see if it resolves
                the issue.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Prefer temporary files instead of RAM (slower)</strong>.
                This option reduces backup job performance.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Allow backup of zero files to succeed</strong>. If a
                backup job completes successfully but did not include any files
                in the backup, Cloud Backup will by default mark the job as
                &quot;Error&quot; status. This is a useful feature to help
                detect against accidental path changes or incorrect file
                selections. However in some cases you may expect a backup job to
                succeed with no files included. In that case, you can enable
                this option.

              If the device is online, Cloud Backup will try to run the backup

              started, the Cloud Backup Server will inject a &quot;Missed&quot;
              job into the customer's backup job log. Administrators can use
              these &quot;Missed&quot; backup job notifications when monitoring
              the job history for their customers, to ensure that backup jobs
              run on schedule.

              &quot;Retention&quot; is the concept of classifying backed-up
              data, to determine what data should be kept, and what data can be
              safely removed in order to free up disk space. For instance, you
              may choose to keep the last 30 days' of backed-up data, or all
              data from the last 100 backup jobs; but any data older than this
              is unlikely to be useful and can be safely removed.

            <p>
              A &quot;retention pass&quot; is the act of cleaning up data from
              the Storage Vault that exceeds the configured retention policy.
            </p>
            <p>
              During a retention pass, Cloud Backup looks at each backed-up job
              within the Storage Vault and determines whether it meets the
              retention policy. If the retention policy states that the
              backed-up job can be safely removed, the backed-up job is removed
              from the Storage Vault. Once all backed-up jobs are checked
              against the retention policy, any data chunks that are no longer
              referenced by a backed-up job can then be pruned to save disk
              space.

            <p>A retention pass may run automatically after each backup job.</p>
            <p>
              Because the retention pass is a destructive action, it temporarily
              requires the Storage Vault to be completely idle, to take
              exclusive control over the Storage Vault. Cloud Backup has to
              determine a possible idle time. Without loss of generality, any
              possible idle-time always occurs at the end of some backup job. By
              checking at the end of a backup job as to whether the Storage
              Vault is idle, Cloud Backup is guaranteed to find the idle
              time-window as long as such a time-window exists.
            </p>
            <p>
              An automatic retention pass is not necessarily critical, and so if
              a backup job comes to an end without the Storage Vault being idle,
              the retention pass is not immediately &quot;overdue&quot;.
            </p>
            <p>
              The &quot;overdue&quot; rules for automatic retention passes are
              based on the time since the previous successful retention pass,
              and, the number of jobs exceeding the configured retention policy.
              The exact rules are subject to change in future versions of Cloud
              Backup. As of Cloud Backup 19.12.4, the rules are as follows:

              application, or an administrator can remotely initiate this by

              You can set this property on a per-Storage Vault basis. For

              On this tab, you can configure the data storage location for this
              Storage Vault. A number of types are available, including local
              disk storage, network accounts, and cloud storage providers.

              Cloud Backup automatically enables encryption for all Storage
              Vaults. This is not customizable; this tab solely serves to
              indicate that fact to unaware users.
            </p>
            <p>
              Storage Vault encryption is initialized upon first-use. You can
              use this tab to tell whether a Storage Vault has been initialized
              with an encryption key, and when the initialization was performed
              (according to records in the user account profile).

            <p>
              Each device in an account has their own private Protected Items,
              but shares the Storage Vaults. Because Storage Vaults are the unit
              of deduplication, all backups from all devices in the account can
              be deduplicated against each other. This also means that devices
              can restore each others' data.
            </p>
            <p>An administrator can revoke devices from your account.</p>
            <p>
              A device has a &quot;friendly name&quot; that is set by the device
              when it is first registered. The &quot;friendly name&quot;
              defaults to the hostname of the PC. An administrator can rename
              devices in an account.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because additional devices may incur a cost, an administrator can
              also limit the total number of devices in an account.
            </p>
            <p>
              If a device is live-connected to the Cloud Backup Server, an
              administrator can request that the device performs certain
              actions.
