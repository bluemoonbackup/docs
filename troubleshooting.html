<p>Comet Server on Windows consists of two parts: <code>cometd.exe</code> and <code>cometd-service.exe</code>. The latter binary is registered as a service with Windows, and is responsible for ensuring that the former binary stays running.</p>
<p>If Comet Server encounters an error and closes, the service binary will restart it. If the Comet Server is repeatedly unable to start - if it closes immediately when launched, several hundred times consecutively - then the service manager will assume the error is permanent and abandon restarting the process. This condition is displayed as the &quot;Paused&quot; state.</p>
<p>You can resolve this issue by resolving the underlying issue with the service. The error message should be recorded in Comet Server's log file.</p>
<p>You can view Comet Server's log files</p>
<ul>
<li>in Comet Server Service Manager, use the Service menu &gt; &quot;Browse log files&quot; option, or</li>
<li>by browsing the <code>C:\ProgramData\Comet\logs</code> directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Comet Server makes one log file per day. The error should be recorded in the most recent file (highest number in name / latest modification date).</p>

<p>If you are locked out of the Comet Server web interface, you can change your administrator password by editing the <code>cometd.cfg</code> file.</p>
<ol>
<li>Stop the server, and edit the <code>cometd.cfg</code> file</li>
<li>Find the <code>AdminUsers</code> section for the administrator user in question</li>
<li>Set <code>"PasswordFormat"</code> to <code>0</code></li>
<li>Set <code>"Password"</code> to e.g. <code>"admin"</code></li>
<li>Save the file and restart the server.</li>

<p>A user account has a bucket on a Storage Role Comet Server at the address 127.0.0.1, but this address was not selected for management by Constellation. Aside from the standard warnings about managing Constellation, the 127.0.0.1 is a special case.</p>
<p>If Comet Server is configured to listen on all network interfaces, the server will be accessible on both 127.0.0.1 as well as LAN, WAN, or DNS addresses. If you log in to either the Comet Backup application or the Comet Server web interface at 127.0.0.1, and request a new Storage Vault from a Comet Server configured as &quot;Local&quot; (or <code>$self$</code> in <code>cometd.cfg</code>), the resulting Storage Vault will be configured using 127.0.0.1 as the remote network address.</p>
<p>However, 127.0.0.1 has a different meaning depending on where it is found. The connection will fail if the Comet Backup client is not running on the same machine. There may also be unintended consequences if the account is replicated to another server.</p>
<p>To avoid this problem, either </p>
<ul>
<li>always use the external DNS name for your Comet Server when requesting new Storage Vaults, or</li>
<li>change the Request destination to use &quot;Remote&quot; with an external DNS name instead of &quot;Local&quot; (or <code>$self$</code> in <code>cometd.cfg</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>A similar caveat applies to the software downloads, which can include embedded server address details.</p>

<p>An &quot;Access Denied&quot; error message means that the Windows user account running the backup job does not have access to read the file content.</p>
<p>Current versions of Comet automatically creates a service account with all necessary permissions to read local files. If you are experiencing &quot;Access Denied&quot; errors, you may be trying to back up a network path that has been mounted as a directory. Please see the &quot;Accessing Windows network shares and UNC paths&quot; section below for more information.
If you are experiencing &quot;Access Denied&quot; errors and you are certain that you are not backing up a mounted network path, please contact support.
You may also be trying to backup a local Protected Item to which the backup software does not have read-access, such as a file within a user's home directory. In this case, you will need to alter the backup delegate service, and change it to 'logon as' an account which does have access to the Protected Item.</p>

<p>Comet Backup is a safe application. Any such detection is a &quot;false positive&quot;.</p>
<p>When Comet Backup is rebranded, it might seem like a new, unknown program. An unknown program that installs system services, accesses files on the disk and uploads them to the network, might be considered to be malware if it was installed without consent. Unfortunately it's understandable for an Antivirus product to detect this.</p>
<p>In this situation, there are some actions you can take:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please ensure your Antivirus product is fully up-to-date.</li>
<li>Please contact Comet Support with a screenshot of the error message. In some situations, it may be possible for our developers to resolve the issue.</li>
<li>Choose to &quot;allow&quot; or &quot;white-list&quot; the file in the Antivirus software. This may send a signal to the Antivirus software vendor that the software is safe (e.g. ESET LiveGrid, Windows Defender Automatic Sample Submission, Kaspersky KSN, etc).</li>
<li>Enable Authenticode signing on Windows. This may provide additional &quot;reputation&quot; to the software installer.</li>

<p>Comet Backup uploads files to Comet Server (or to a cloud storage provider) over the internet. Occasionally, you may see errors such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Couldn't save data chunk:</code></li>
<li><code>HTTP/1.x transport connection broken</code></li>
<li><code>net/http: request canceled (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)</code></li>
<li><code>wsarecv</code></li>
<li><code>wsasend</code></li>
<li><code>An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host</code></li>
<li><code>dial tcp: lookup [...]: no such host</code></li>
<li><code>connectex: A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond.</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Comet Backup retries the upload several times, but eventually gives up. After a failed data chunk upload, you may see several more messages of the form <code>Couldn't save data chunk: context canceled</code> while Comet terminates the other upload threads.</p>
<p>Network errors have many possible causes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer's PC</li>
<li>Customer's network</li>
<li>Customer's ISP</li>
<li>Internet-wide outages between customer's ISP and your ISP</li>
<li>Your ISP</li>
<li>Your network</li>
<li>Your Comet Server hardware</li>
<li>Comet Server software</li>
</ul>
<p>To troubleshoot these issues, please check:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Does the backup succeed if it is retried?</p>
<ul>
<li>Many network errors are temporary and will only occur rarely. In addition, a repeated second backup job will often run faster because many of the existing data chunks have already been uploaded. (Any unused data chunks in the Storage Vault will be automatically cleaned up by the next retention pass.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the error message always happen at a certain time of day?</p>
<ul>
<li>It may be possible to reschedule the backup to avoid times of heavy internet congestion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there any corresponding messages for around the same time in your Comet Server logs?</p>
<ul>
<li>This is important to determine the cause of some failures.</li>
<li>Some relevant Comet Server log messages take the form <code>Error saving upload stream</code> or <code>Blocking re-upload of preexisting file</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<span class="docsSectionMarker"><span id="accessing-windows-network-shares-and-unc-paths" class="docsSectionMarkerChild"></span></span></div><div class="docs-box"><h2>Accessing Windows network shares and UNC paths&nbsp;<a class="docsSectionLinkIcon" href="troubleshooting.html#accessing-windows-network-shares-and-unc-paths">&para;</a></h2>
<p><em>This section applies to both Comet Server and Comet Backup.</em></p>
<p>Comet can back up Windows network paths, and back up to Windows network storage (SMB / CIFS). However, because Comet runs as a service user, there are some issues with authentication to be aware of.</p>
<p>Please note that if you are using Comet Backup to back up data from a network device, you should prefer to install Comet Backup directly on the device instead of backing it up over the network. This will also significantly improve performance, as less data needs to be transferred over the LAN.</p>
<span class="docsSectionMarker"><span id="mapped-network-drives" class="docsSectionMarkerChild"></span></span><h3>Mapped network drives&nbsp;<a class="docsSectionLinkIcon" href="troubleshooting.html#mapped-network-drives">&para;</a></h3>
<p>On Windows, each logged-on user session has its own set of mapped network drives. The service user account is unlikely to have any mapped drives. If you see error messages like <code>WARNING Missing: 'Z:\'</code>, this is probably the reason. You can work around this by using a UNC path instead.</p>
<p>The Comet Backup desktop application will automatically convert mapped network drives to their UNC path equivalents.</p>
<span class="docsSectionMarker"><span id="authentication" class="docsSectionMarkerChild"></span></span><h3>Authentication&nbsp;<a class="docsSectionLinkIcon" href="troubleshooting.html#authentication">&para;</a></h3>
<p>If the UNC share requires authentication, the service user account is probably not logged-in to the UNC share. If you see error messages like <code>WARNING Lstat: CreateFile \\?\UNC\...: Access is denied.</code>, this is probably the reason.</p>
<p>Comet 18.6.5 and later have built-in options for setting Windows network authentication credentials.</p>
<p>For versions of Comet prior to 18.6.5, workarounds are available for both Comet Backup and Comet Server. Ranked in order of preference:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you are using Comet Server to store data on a network device, you may be able to install Comet Server on the network device. If the network device is a NAS box (e.g. Synology / QNAP), Comet Server can be installed on Linux x86_64 NAS boxes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are storing data on a network share, you can also work around this issue by switching from Windows network shares (SMB) to a network protocol that has built-in credential support. For instance, a S3-compatible server (e.g. the free Minio server) or an SFTP server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Comet Backup, you can work around this issue by adding <code>net use \\HOST\SHARE /user:USERNAME PASSWORD</code> as a &quot;Before&quot; command to the backup job.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are storing data on a UNC path, you can add this &quot;Before&quot; command on the Storage Vault instead of on the Protected Item. This will ensure it is run for all backup jobs going to that Storage Vault.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can work around this issue in Comet Backup or in Comet Server by changing the Windows Service to use a different user account.</p>
<ul>
<li>For Comet Server, this is the <code>Comet Server</code> service.</li>
<li>For Comet Backup, this is the <code>Comet Backup (delegate service)</code> service.</li>
<li>If you are using Comet on a Windows Server machine that is acting as the Domain Controller, you must choose a domain account.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Some individual software, while it is launched from the within the users session, it may elevate itself when running or run under the System user account. If this happens, the encryption keys will not be available to that software's process and access will be denied to the containers.</p>
<p>Example scenarios where the above behavior may be experienced are when software is running under a different user context within the users session. Comet runs the backup as a service user account (usually &quot;NT SERVICE\backup.delegate&quot; or &quot;LOCAL SYSTEM&quot; in some cases).

<pre><code>Error "VSS Error: Couldn't take snapshot. The shadow copy provider had an unexpected error while trying to process the specified operation"</code></pre>
<p>Possible causes for this error include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Backing up mapped network drives. You cannot use VSS on network share.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shadow storage on the source drives is not configured or not large enough. The shadow storage size can be checked and manually changed through command prompt:</p>
<ul>
<li>To check the current limit set: <code>vssadmin list shadowstorage</code></li>
<li>To change the limit: <code>vssadmin Resize ShadowStorage /For=X: /On=X: /Maxsize=XX%</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Microsoft's native snapshot manager is only able to perform one snapshot at a time. If a snapshot process is already running when the backup job starts, then the backup job could fail. Stopping and restarting the Volume Shadow Copy service can resolve this problem. To do this, open an elevated command prompt window and run the following commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>net stop vss</code></li>
<li><code>net start vss</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A reboot of the server has also been known to clean up the snapshot manager correctly, should a service restart not resolve the issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Multiple backup products installed could cause this error. Many backup solutions have their own proprietary snapshot manager which can cause conflicts with other backup solutions installed on the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VSS snapshots have been known to fail because an advanced format drive is connected to the machine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check you have all the VSS writers installed and working. On an elevated command prompt: <code>vssadmin list writers</code></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>When using the &quot;MX Direct&quot; option to send email, your Comet Server is acting as an MTA (Mail Transfer Agent) to deliver the email directly to the recipient. There are strict requirements on MTAs to not have your outgoing emails discarded as spam.</p>
<p>You may find more information online about running an email server and not having your messages discarded as spam. The advice following are only general guidelines:</p>

<p>Many email servers will maintain a list of known-bad IP ranges that have served spam emails in the past. If you are hosting Comet Server on a cloud VPS or cloud server, it's likely that the IP address has been used by someone else in the past. This is especially likely with the very small size of the IPv4 internet.</p>

<p>Reverse DNS is a system where, for an IP address <code>1.2.3.4</code>, looking up the special domain name <code>4.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa</code> produces a <code>TXT</code> record explaining the owner of the <code>1.2.3.4</code> IP address.</p>
<p>One anti-spam measure in email is Forward Confirmed Reverse DNS (FCrDNS). Looking up the DNS of the reverse DNS should produce the original domain name again. This is a method of ensuring that the domain name owner is also the IP address owner, an important authenticity check for anti-spam.</p>
<p>Many cloud server providers will automatically configure the RDNS record to a suitable value. However, by changing it to match your domain name exactly, you may help ensure the email delivery is successful. If you do not have the access necessary to configure reverse DNS then you will need to find out who owns your IP block (usually this is your ISP or hosting provider) and contact them to configure it.</p>

<p>Comet Backup is responsible for closing-off a job log with Comet Server. If the PC is shut down unexpectedly, a job would be left in &quot;Running&quot; state indefinitely.</p>
<p>The old, inactive &quot;Running&quot; jobs will be cleaned up automatically if Comet sees an opportunity to prove that they are no longer running.</p>
<p>As of Comet 21.9.4, the following actions will clean up old, inactive &quot;Running&quot; jobs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run an exclusive action against the Storage Vault
<ul>
<li>For safety reasons, some operations require Comet to temporarily take exclusive control over a Storage Vault. Comet makes a number of checks to verify this exclusivity, but the practical benefit is that when such an operation runs, all past backup jobs must no longer be running by definition.
<ul>
<li>A reindex operation (n.b. may take a considerable amount of time), or <em>(prior to Comet 21.9.4)</em> a retention pass</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Run a new backup job on the same device
<ul>
<li>Comet can compare lockfiles in the Storage Vault with the running process IDs in Task Manager. If a lockfile was created by a process that is no longer running, that job must have stopped.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Run a software update
<ul>
<li>If a software update job completes successfully including a changed version number, the software update process must have terminated all prior jobs. All past backup jobs on this device are no longer running</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Note: If a backup job has <code>before</code> or <code>after</code> commands, then the <code>Cancel</code> command may not appear to work. If the commands are stalled, then the cancellation request may have no apparent effect until the commands either finish, or are stopped. The commands are started by the <code>backup.delegate</code> service, and as such, are not readily visible in a normally-logged-in user-view of Processes in the Windows Task manager. The processes may be found in the 'details' view, and can usually be stopped from there. Once stopped, the cancellation should work normally.</p>
<span class="docsSectionMarker"><span id="out-of-memory" class="docsSectionMarkerChild"></span></span></div><div class="docs-box"><h2>Out of memory&nbsp;<a class="docsSectionLinkIcon" href="troubleshooting.html#out-of-memory">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Comet Backup needs RAM to run. The main cause for this is to hold deduplication indexes; therefore the amount of RAM used is proportional to the size of the Storage Vault.</p>
<p>You might see these error messages:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>runtime: VirtualAlloc of 1048576 bytes failed with errno=1455</code> on Windows</li>
<li><code>0x5AF ERROR_COMMITMENT_LIMIT: The paging file is too small for this operation to complete.</code> on Windows</li>
<li><code>fatal error: out of memory</code> on all platforms</li>
</ul>
<p>On Linux, when the system is out of memory (OOM), the kernel &quot;OOM Killer&quot; subsystem will immediately terminate a process of its choosing, to free up memory. If you see an error message like <code>signal: killed</code> in Comet on Linux, this means the process was terminated by a user or a subsystem, that might possibly be the OOM Killer. You can check for this in <code>dmesg</code> or <code>kern.log</code>.</p>
<p>You can reduce Comet Backup's RAM usage by trying to limit how much data is in each Storage Vault. For instance, instead of having multiple devices backing up into a single Storage Vault, create multiple Storage Vaults for each device. This will reduce the deduplication efficiency, but it will also reduce the necessary memory usage.</p>
<span class="docsSectionMarker"><span id="tradeoffs" class="docsSectionMarkerChild"></span></span><h3>Trade-offs&nbsp;<a class="docsSectionLinkIcon" href="troubleshooting.html#tradeoffs">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Some trade-offs are possible, that can reduce Comet's memory usage at the expense of other system resource types:</p>
<span class="docsSectionMarker"><span id="rescan-unchanged-files" class="docsSectionMarkerChild"></span></span><h4>Rescan unchanged files&nbsp;<a class="docsSectionLinkIcon" href="troubleshooting.html#rescan-unchanged-files">&para;</a></h4>
<p>This option causes Comet to read more data from the source disk, reading less data from the Storage Vault into in-memory indexes. This can have a varied impact on RAM usage, and may be positive or negative depending on the shape of your directories.</p>
<span class="docsSectionMarker"><span id="prefer-temporary-files-instead-of-ram" class="docsSectionMarkerChild"></span></span><h4>Prefer temporary files instead of RAM&nbsp;<a class="docsSectionLinkIcon" href="troubleshooting.html#prefer-temporary-files-instead-of-ram">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The &quot;Prefer temporary files instead of RAM&quot; option on a backup job schedule will cause Comet to keep indexes in an on-disk database file, instead of a pure in-memory index. The on-disk database file is mapped into pageable memory, that can more easily be reclaimed by the OS when the system is under memory pressure.</p>
<p>Depending on how you measure Comet's memory usage, this option may not immediately appear to have lower memory usage if your measurement includes <code>mmap</code> disk sections. However, the resident working set is reduced.</p>
<p>There is a major performance penalty for using this option (approximately 5x or worse) and it is not generally recommended.</p>

<p>Comet Backup supports multiple devices backing up into a shared Storage Vault simultaneously.</p>
<p>A retention pass first looks at what data chunks exist in the Vault, then secondly deletes the unused ones.</p>
<p>A backup job first looks at what data chunks exist in the Vault, then secondly uploads new chunks from the local data, and uploads a backup snapshot that relies on both pre-existing and newly-uploaded chunks.</p>
<p>It is perfectly safe for multiple backup jobs to run simultaneously, even from multiple devices.</p>
<p>In Comet 21.9.4 and later, it is also perfectly safe to run backup and retention jobs simultaneously. A mark-and-sweep algorithm is used to safely delete data chunks while other backup operations are proceeding concurrently.</p>
<span class="docsSectionMarker"><span id="lock-files" class="docsSectionMarkerChild"></span></span><h3>Lock files&nbsp;<a class="docsSectionLinkIcon" href="troubleshooting.html#lock-files">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In order to check whether a retention pass is currently running, Comet must communicate between all devices that could potentially be using the Storage Vault.</p>
<p>In order to determine whether any other device is actively using a Storage Vault, Comet writes a temporary text file into the Storage Vault, and deletes it when the job is completed. This is the only mechanism supported across all Storage Vault types (i.e. local disk / SFTP / S3 / etc). Then, any other job can look for these files to see what other operations are taking place concurrently.</p>

<p>If Comet is stopped suddenly (e.g. PC crash), the lock file would not be removed. All other Comet processes would not realize that the job had stopped. This could prevent proper functioning of backup jobs and/or retention passes.</p>
<p>Comet will alert you to this issue by failing the job. The error message should explain which device and/or job was responsible for originating the now-stale lock file.</p>
<p>You may see error messages of the form:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Locked by user '...' on this device (PID #...) since ... (... days ago)</code></li>
<li><code>Locked by user '...' on computer '...' (PID #...) since ... (... days ago)</code></li>
<li><code>However, the responsible process might have stopped.</code></li>
<li><code>If you investigate this process, and are absolutely certain it won't resume, then it's safe to ignore it and continue.</code></li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible to delete lock files to recover from this situation. However, you MUST investigate the issue to ensure that the responsible process really has stopped. Consider that a PC may go to sleep at any time, and wake up days or weeks later, and immediately resume from the middle of a backup or retention operation; <strong>if the lock files were removed incorrectly, data loss is highly likely</strong>.</p>
<p>If you are sure that the responsible process is stopped, you can delete the lock files.</p>

<li>Identify where the bucket is located via: Cluster -&gt; About This Cluster -&gt; Bucket Users. </li>
<li>Record the 'Bucket Instance Location' for the bucket with the ID &quot;969c047a-bb90-4a29-b6f8-07a2d56bee8f&quot;. The 'Bucket Instance Location' will be the 'friendly' name for one of your storage locations.</li>
<li>Access the storage location using your file explorer program, web browser, or however you normally access the storage location, to view and edit files. </li>
<li>In the storage location, find the folder which is the bucket with ID &quot;969c047a...&quot;, and open the folder for editing.</li>
<li>Open the 'packindex' sub-folder, and delete the file with ID which starts with 'pppppppp'. There may be more than one packindex files to delete. </li>

<p>The first step on accessing a new, uninitalised Storage Vault is to generate and store some encryption material.</p>
<p>If a backup to a new Storage Vault seems to hang at this initial step, it's likely that Comet Backup is failing to access the storage location, and repeatedly retrying- and timing-out. An error message may appear after some extended duration.</p>
<p>Some possible causes of this issue are</p>
<ul>
<li>Storage Vault misconfiguration
<ul>
<li>For Storage Vaults located in a Comet Server bucket: check the Storage Vault properties &gt; &quot;Hostname&quot; field, that it points to a valid URL and not e.g. <code>127.0.0.1</code></li>
<li>For Storage Vaults using cloud bucket credentials: double-check the credentials, and ensure there are no extra spaces pasted around the field values</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Outdated CA certificates
<ul>
<li>This would prevent Comet Backup from making an HTTPS / SSL connection to the storage location</li>
<li>On Windows, run Windows Update
<ul>
<li>For Storage Vaults located in a Comet Server bucket, you can also check if the system Internet Explorer browser is able to load the Comet Server's web interface</li>
</ul></li>
<li>On Linux, update the <code>ca-certificates</code> package</li>
</ul></li>

<p>OneDrive, Google Drive, and similar cloud document editors/storage all operate alike in that user files are stored as on-demand files in the respective cloud server repositories. These locations which are not easily accessible by Comet, regardless of whether a device can view and access them. Backing up these files is <em>ONLY</em> possible if you make a local copy of these files available to the Comet client software.
This may have unwanted consequences on network loading and local disk space.</p>
<span class="docsSectionMarker"><span id="onedrive" class="docsSectionMarkerChild"></span></span><h3>OneDrive&nbsp;<a class="docsSectionLinkIcon" href="troubleshooting.html#onedrive">&para;</a></h3>
<p>To save on disk space, OneDrive (and some other cloud storage providers) use a system where some files are only &quot;virtually&quot; stored on the local disk, and are materialized from the cloud storage on-demand.</p>
<span class="docsSectionMarker"><span id="error-media-is-write-protected-backing-up-onedrive-with-vss" class="docsSectionMarkerChild"></span></span><h4>Error &quot;Media is write protected&quot; backing up OneDrive with VSS&nbsp;<a class="docsSectionLinkIcon" href="troubleshooting.html#error-media-is-write-protected-backing-up-onedrive-with-vss">&para;</a></h4>
<p>When you use the &quot;Take filesystem snapshot&quot; option in Comet, Comet takes a VSS snapshot of the disk. This is a read-only snapshot.</p>
<p>When you back up the OneDrive directory with VSS enabled, OneDrive is not able to download files into the snapshot, because the snapshot is read-only. This causes the &quot;Media is write protected&quot; error message.</p>
<p>In this situation, your OneDrive data is not being protected by Comet and is not available for restore.</p>
<p>You can workaround this issue by creating two Protected Items: one with VSS enabled, that excludes the OneDrive directory; and a second one with VSS disabled, that only includes the OneDrive directory.</p>
<p>Note that if OneDrive needs to materialize a lot of data from the cloud, then backing up the OneDrive directory may cause a lot of data to be downloaded.</p>

<p>If you encounter the &quot;Access to the cloud file is denied&quot; error message, this means that file in question does not exist on the local PC, and the OneDrive virtual filesystem driver is refusing to download this file on-demand for Comet to read it.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the only available workaround is to disable the &quot;Files-On-Demand&quot; feature in OneDrive. However, this may cause an unacceptable increase in local disk usage for some customers.</p>
<p>To disable the &quot;Files-On-Demand&quot; feature in OneDrive:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click OneDrive in the System Tray</li>
<li>Click the menu icon -&gt; Settings -&gt; Settings tab -&gt; &quot;Files-On-Demand&quot; section -&gt; disable the &quot;Save space and download files as you use them&quot; option</li>

<p>The Google File Stream app creates a virtual drive, e.g. G:\, that streams-in data from a business Google Drive account, over the internet, on-demand, without using any local disk storage, other than a small cache.</p>
<p>The virtual drive only exists for the interactive logged-in user session.</p>
<p>Comet Backup runs all backups (both interactive and scheduled backups) using a service user account. Different logon sessions have their own set of mapped drive letters, and the service session simply does not see that the virtual drive, G:\, exists.</p>
<p>It's still visible in the Comet Backup GUI file picker, which runs as the interactive logged-on user for performance reasons.</p>
<p>Ideally it would be possible to mount the virtual G:\ drive &quot;For all users&quot;, to resolve this issue. </p>
<p>Currently, this does not appear to be possible in File Stream: <a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/apps/iRH9lD9NM90">https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/apps/iRH9lD9NM90</a> </p>
<p>Note: If the virtual G:\ drive can be made available to all users, the process of backing up this data requires that it be downloaded first from the Google Drive, and this may cause large amounts of inbound network traffic.</p>
<p>There are third-party programs for mounting Google Drive as a drive letter that may support &quot;All Users&quot;. StableBit Cloud Drive (commercial) may do this, as well as 'rclone mount'.</p>

<p>EFS is a Windows feature that allows you to encrypt individual files on disk.

<p>The &quot;Windows System Backup&quot; Protected Item type uses the <code>wbadmin</code> program to write a disk image to the spool directory; backs up the spool directory with Comet; and then cleans up the spool directory. Comet automatically removes this directory after the backup, even if the backup failed.</p>
<p>If the directory exists at the start of a backup job, this could mean either</p>
<ol>
<li>Comet did not have the chance to clean up the directory (e.g. the PC was not shut down safely); or</li>
<li>another Comet backup job is running simultaneously; or</li>
<li>another non-Comet software on the PC is also using the <code>wbadmin</code> functionality for System State or Windows System Backup.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can avoid case 2 above by using the &quot;Skip if already running&quot; option.</p>
<p>It's not generally possible to distinguish between case 1 and case 3 above. If you look at the job history or the customer's PC, and you are able to make a positive distinction between these cases, it may be safe to delete the directory.</p>
<p>You can temporarily add the following command as a &quot;Before&quot; command to the backup job:</p>
<p><code>powershell -command "if (Test-Path -Path 'X:\WindowsImageBackup') { Remove-Item -Recurse -Force 'X:\WindowsImageBackup'} else { exit 0 }"</code></p>
<p>You should then remove this command from the job settings after the command has run, because this command would cause problems if two Comet backup jobs ever run simultaneously in the future.</p>

<pre><code>Error "An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions" in Comet Server</code></pre>
<p>This error message occurs when configuring Comet Server on Windows to listen on an IP/port combination that is either (A) forbidden by the firewall, or (B) in-use by another application. Usually this affects port <code>80</code> or <code>443</code>.</p>

<span class="docsSectionMarker"><span id="firewall" class="docsSectionMarkerChild"></span></span><h3>Firewall&nbsp;<a class="docsSectionLinkIcon" href="troubleshooting.html#firewall">&para;</a></h3>
<p>One possibility is that the system firewall is preventing Comet Server from binding to this IP/Port. Comet Server automatically makes a firewall exception for itself in Windows Firewall.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is a third-party firewall installed, that could be preventing Comet Server from binding to this IP/port?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Is there any website visible when you browse to the IP/port in a web browser?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is IIS installed?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you open Command Prompt as Administrator and run <code>netstat -o</code>, it shoudl list all the open network connections.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you check if any process is using the affected port (e.g. <code>:80</code>), and compare the PID in Task Manager to find the process?</li>
</ul>
<p>If the affected process is &quot;SYSTEM&quot; (PID 4), then the <code>http.sys</code> driver is responsible for binding the port. The network system from IIS (<code>http.sys</code>) is also a necessary component of some other Windows features and may have been installed automatically.</p>
<p>You can run <code>net stop http</code> to stop the driver and all the services that are using it.</p>
<p>Some common services that use this driver are</p>
<ul>
<li>World Wide Web Publishing Service (IIS)</li>
<li>&quot;Web Deployment Agent Service&quot; (<code>MsDepSvc</code> service)</li>
<li>&quot;SQL Server Reporting Services&quot; services</li>
<li>Windows Remote Management (<code>WS-Management</code> service)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you discover the services are essential, you could work around this issue by</p>
<ul>
<li>configuring Comet Server to listen on a different port; or</li>
<li>configuring Comet Server to listen on a different port, and use NAT translation to make it seem like the in-use port to the outside world; or</li>
<li>configuring Comet Server to listen on a specific interface or a different IP address.</li>

<p>During a backup job, Comet uses approximately</p>
<ul>
<li>approximately 10-20 handles for files being read from the disk; and</li>
<li>approximately 10-20 handles for open network connections; and</li>
<li>an unknown number of temporary cache files created during the &quot;Building cache&quot; phase</li>

<p>If you are backing up from the SMB server, you could work around this issue by</p>
<ul>
<li>installing Comet Backup directly on the network device (e.g. for Synology, enabling SSH access and install the command-line Linux version), to back up the files directly. This may have significantly better performance, as less data needs to travel across the LAN and the disk access latency is significantly improved.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, by</p>
<ul>
<li>logging the interactive user account out of Windows entirely before the job starts. This will close their network sessions. Comet will successfully log in to the network share; you should add <code>net use /DELETE</code> as an After command in Comet to ensure the service user logs out again after the backup</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, by</p>
<ul>
<li>logging the interactive user account out of the network share before the job starts, and logging them back in afterward. You may be able to use Windows Task Scheduler for this with the &quot;Run only when user is logged on&quot; option to ensure that the commands run inside the correct logon session:
<ul>
<li><code>net use /DELETE</code> in Task Scheduler before the backup window, to log the interactive user out</li>
<li>Enter network credentials in Comet, so the service user logs in</li>
<li><code>net use /DELETE</code> as an After command in Comet, so the service user logs out</li>
<li><code>net use</code> in Task Scheduler after the backup window, to log the interactive user back in again</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are backing up <em>to</em> the SMB server, you could work around this issue by</p>
<ul>

<p>Comet tells machines apart by their &quot;device ID&quot;. This is automatically determined from a mix of hardware and software identifiers.</p>
<p>One possible cause of this issue is if the two VMs were originally clones of each other. If you have cloned a VM in the past, it might have the same hardware and software identifiers, and so appear to Comet as the same device.</p>
<p>If multiple devices appear to Comet as the same device, they will share the same Protected Items and job scheduling. This causes follow-on issues for logging and reporting.</p>
<p>You can resolve this issue by changing the hardware or software ID for the affected VM. This will influence Comet's device ID to force the devices to be detected as different devices.</p>
<p>On both Linux and MacOS, the SSH host keys are one signal that influences the generated device IDs. Installing SSH, or regenerating the SSH host keys, will cause the device ID to change.</p>
<p>On Windows, you can add extra data to influence the generated device ID by creating a registry key.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Registry Editor (<code>regedit.exe</code>)</li>
<li>Browse to the <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\backup-tool</code> folder key, creating it if it does not already exist
<ul>
<li>The <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\cometbackup</code> folder key is also recognized for backwards compatibility</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Create a &quot;String Value&quot; with name <code>DeviceIdentificationEntropy</code></li>
<li>Set any random text as the Data value. This value will influence the generated device ID.</li>
<li>Restart all Comet services (e.g. <code>backup.delegate</code> and <code>backup.elevator</code>)</li>

<p>If this error message occurs immediately, it means Comet was unable to connect to the Storage Vault at all, because the encryption key in the user's Storage Vault settings does not match the files in the <code>/keys/</code> subdirectory in the data storage location.</p>
<p>When a Storage Vault is used for the first time, Comet generates a random encryption key, and stores it in an encrypted form in both (A) the user's profile, and (B) in the <code>/keys/</code> subdirectory in the data storage location. It's important that these match at all times. If they do not match, Comet will be unable to use the data inside the Storage Vault.</p>
<p>You may potentially encounter this issue in the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the first time this Storage Vault was used, multiple backup jobs ran simultaneously</p>
<ul>
<li>The first-time initialization make take a few seconds. If multiple initialization jobs were running simultaneously, this may have caused a conflict when saving the encryption key into the user profile</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you were performing a Seed Load, but...</p>
<ul>
<li>created a new Storage Vault in the client instead of reusing the existing one; or</li>
<li>did not copy the <code>/keys/</code> subdirectory or the top-level <code>config</code> file; or</li>
<li>misconfigured the &quot;subdirectory&quot; or &quot;path&quot; option in the Storage Vault settings</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you change the Storage Vault location to point to another user account's Storage Vault</p>
<ul>
<li>Data locations cannot be simply reused by multiple user accounts - the other user account would have a different encryption key. If you want to share a single data storage location between multiple customers, you should have both customers log in to the same account as devices, so that they can share the Storage Vault settings including the encryption material.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>RAM usage</p>
<ul>
<li>With large (multi-TB) Storage Vaults, there are many different data chunks that could be deduplicated against. Comet will start to use a few GB of RAM to hold all the indexes for deduplication.

<p>CPU usage</p>
<ul>
<li>Comet compresses and encrypts all data before upload. On weak CPUs this may cause high CPU usage. The CPU usage may become a bottleneck.</li>

<li>
<p>Backup source is a single-queue block device</p>
<ul>
<li>Comet issues many requests to the source disk in parallel. To avoid negatively affecting other programs on the PC, Comet tries to access the source disk at a low OS priority, but this may be ineffectual if your disk only supports a single queue.

<p>For example, if the database was restored to <code>D:\restore-edb</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check EDB file state: <code>eseutil /MH "D:\restore-edb\File\Mailbox.edb"</code></li>
<li>Apply log files: <code>eseutil /R E00 /D "D:\restore-edb\File" /D "D:\restore-edb\Logs" /S "D:\restore-edb\Logs"</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Comet Backup tried to read a file from the disk for backup, but Windows was unable to provide the file content.</p>
<p>This specific error message comes from the disk driver. If the local disk is a HDD or SSD, the most common cause is a bad sector in the physical hardware: please use the <code>chkdsk</code> tool to schedule a boot-time sector check.</p>

<p>The buckets in the Comet Server storage role all have an ID and a key which must match inside the customer's Storage Vault settings.</p>
<p>These are just login fields, and are not tied to the underlying data encryption. </p>
<p>This explains why you can use the &quot;seed load&quot; process to switch a Storage Vault to point to a different location. The access key is just about accessing the location, not about what's inside it.</p>
<p>Steps to re-key:</p>
<ol>
<li>make sure Constellation is not actively deleting anything; then</li>
<li>on the Storage Buckets page, add a new bucket and note down the keys;</li>
<li>on your server, move all the files from the old bucket to the new bucket;</li>
<li>change the customer's existing Storage Vault so that it points to the new bucket;</li>
<li>(undo step 1 if necessary)</li>
</ol>
<p>This is just like seed loading, but, between two buckets on the same server</p>

<p>Comet Server stores all job log history and messages in the <code>comet-jobs.db3</code> file on the local disk. This file has become damaged.</p>
<p>The best possible solution is to repair the file. Please see the <a href="https://account.cometbackup.com/docs/comet-server-configuration#internal-database-integrity-checks">Internal database integrity checks</a> section for instructions on how to perform an integrity check on this file. That may be sufficient to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>If the integrity check process is not sufficient to resolve the issue, you may resort to recovering a previous job history database file from your Server Self-Backup archives.</p>
<p>If you do not have Server Self-Backup archives, your last resort is to stop Comet Server, delete the <code>comet-jobs.db3</code> file, and start Comet Server again with no job history.</p>

<p>The vault is temporarily locked by device 'XXXXXXXX', while that device finishes its backup and runs its retention pass.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The log file may show something like: <code>Locked by device '[deviceID]' (PID #[XXXX]) since [timestamp] (400hrs59m59s ago)</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The final automatic phase of the backup process is for the device performing the backup to temporarily 'lock' the Storage Vault for a few minutes so that it can delete old snapshots, unreferenced data, etc, per the retention policy. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the vault is locked, other devices cannot start writing to the vault. This lock ensures that data which is in the process of being added, but not yet fully-referenced in the index, is not deleted. As long as the Storage Vault is not under continuous use with over-lapping backup jobs, one backup job will eventually 'finish last', and will run the retention pass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the device goes offline during this final phase (power-cut, sudden sleep mode, network connection lost, etc), then the final phase may not be completed. The 'lock' will stay in place, and the vault will remain in a not-writeable state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can find which device is locking the vault via: Accounts -&gt; Users -&gt; name -&gt; Devices tab -&gt; View -&gt; tick to enable 'Device ID'.
Look in to the profile of a user whose device(s) backup to the same vault.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The device which has locked the vault is the one whose ID starts with &quot;XXXXXXXX...&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NOTE: If you cannot find the device, it has been revoked, and will not now show up in the current device list.
You SHOULD ensure that all running jobs for that device have been successfully cancelled, then proceed to the Unlocking the Vault section below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the job has been running for an unusually long or extended period (as in the above example: '400hrs'), then it may be that the device has been shut-down unexpectedly before a stop signal could be acknowledged by either the Comet server or the device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the job has been running for less than 5 minutes, you SHOULD let it complete by itself.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>BEST OPTION IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES - You SHOULD find the device and 'wake it up', switch it on, or whatever is needed to bring it back 'Online'. If it can not be brought back online, the next best thing is to verify that the device has been lost, stolen, or permanently revoked.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the device can be brought to 'Online' status, you SHOULD allow the backup to complete. </li>
<li>If you believe that the job has genuinely stalled or cannot complete, you MAY send the 'Cancel' signal via: Accounts -&gt; Users -&gt; name -&gt; Actions -&gt; View Job History -&gt; Report (the 'Cancel' button only shows for active jobs).</li>
</ul>
<p>If the device is definitely lost, stolen, destroyed, etc, then the following applies:</p>

<p>Unlocking the Vault:
IMPORTANT: You SHOULD review the documentation to ensure you understand lock-files before you proceed.
Where there is a stalled backup, and you are CERTAIN that the device in question is not running, nor is it likely EVER to resume its backup, please do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>You MUST ensure that no backup jobs are running in that Storage Vault. </li>
<li>Click 'admin' account name (top right) -&gt; toggle-on 'Advanced Options'</li>
<li>Accounts -&gt; Users -&gt; name of a user of the storage vault -&gt; Devices tab -&gt; click 'Online' -&gt; 'Storage Vault tab -&gt; 'Unlock'. This will clear the lock files.</li>
<li>Accounts -&gt; Users -&gt; name of a user of the storage vault -&gt; Devices tab -&gt; click 'Online' -&gt; 'Storage Vault tab -&gt; 'Apply retention rules now'. This will effectively finish-off any prior backup, tidying up old or unreferenced data, removing old snapshots, making it ready for the next backup.</li>
<li>Toggle-off 'Advanced options'.</li>
<li>When finished, check the server and job logs for any errors. Contact support if any insurmountable issues.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Please consider different backup strategies: <a href="https://account.cometbackup.com/docs/troubleshooting#backup-strategies-to-avoid-lock-file-issues">https://account.cometbackup.com/docs/troubleshooting#backup-strategies-to-avoid-lock-file-issues</a></li>

<p>This is a warning only.</p>
<p>Comet checks the size of the Storage Vault in order to see how much data is stored. This information is used for multiple purposes including some health checks (e.g. size should not decrease during an backup) and for enforcing storage quotas. </p>
<p>Most storage destinations (e.g. filesystem / SFTP / ...) do not have any quick way to determine the size of a directory, other than to add up the size of every file within. Comet Server does cache this size information in-memory when it is generated, and is able to return a stale measurement. However, around a backup job, an up-to-date size measurement is desirable.</p>
<p>Storage Vault size measurement is a necessary, but not critical, part of the backup process.
If it fails, the logs shows an alert warning, the backup will proceed, but quota enforcement and the amount that you bill the client may be wrong.</p>

<p>This is a VSS snapshot error. It indicates that the VSS snapshot may have been destroyed while the backup was in progress.
VSS snapshots can be destroyed manually by malware, or by 'cleanup' type programs.
They can also be destroyed if the device is low on disc space, and the device uses space in the 'shadow' area where the snapshot is being put together.</p>
<p>The error messages appears similar to: &quot;Open failed because: open \?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy16\FOLDER\FOLDER\FILE: A device which does not exist was specified&quot;, and &quot;Error for \?\GLOBALROOT\Device\FOLDER\FOLDER\FILE: BackupRead \?\GLOBALROOT\Device\FOLDER\FOLDER\FILE: The device is not ready&quot;.</p>
<ul>
<li>Run the backup again to see if the problem still persists - the issue may have been temporary.</li>
<li>Check the disk space on the device - low disk space is outside of Comet control.</li>

<p>Description:</p>
<ul>
<li>On Linux, the 'Out-Of-Memory (OOM) Killer' is a kernel feature designed to resolve OOM conditions by simply terminating a process with high memory usage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cause:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In some cases, if a customer device uploads a very large file, it may cause increased memory usage on the Comet Server, resulting in the OOM Killer terminating the Comet Server process ('cometd'). In this case, the network connection will be lost between the Comet Backup client app and the Comet Server, resulting in 'unexpected EOF'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Linux distribution's installed service manager (e.g. systemd) should automatically restart Comet Server. In practice, this may result in repeated 'unexpected EOF' errors in the client logs, and being repeatedly logged-out of your Comet Server web interface session.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To verify whether this is the case, note that any processes terminated by the kernel OOM killer are logged in the system log. Depending on your specific Linux distribution, you may check 'dmesg' / 'kern.log' / 'journalctl' for this information. Your Linux distribution may also have enabled an alternative OOM Killer (e.g. <code>oomd</code> from Facebook).</p>
<p>Solutions: </p>
<ul>
<li>Increase RAM available to the Linux VPS</li>
<li>Enable or increase swap space on the Linux server, allowing it to temporarily use a greater amount of memory</li>
</ul>

<p>This error is related to the MacOS 'MRT' or Malware Removal Tool, and is not controlled by Comet.
The issue has been noted thus far only with externally-attached USB storage drives on 10.15.4 Catalina, but it may apply to other MacOS versions.
The MRT removes or quarantines files arbitrarily, resulting in unexpected failures of Comet and its processes.</p>
<p>We have no current solution for this issue, should you encounter it. The suggested solution is to use storage vaults located which are on the local network or cloud-based.</p>

<ul>
<li>This error message originates from outside of Comet, and has to be interpreted. </li>
</ul>
<p>Cause: This error is a result of the client background service not having permission to take a VSS snapshot. </p>
<p>The Comet client-installer explicitly grants permission to take VSS snapshots.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Check the Comet service user account in services.msc. It should be running as the 'NT SERIVCE\backup.delegate' account. This may have been removed by a group policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the device is an Active Directory domain-joined machine, then the AD controller may be enforcing a set of permissions which over-ride the ones that the Comet installer has created. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Solution: None directly through Comet, as an external action has changed the permissions.</p>
<p>Work-around: Reinstall the client software to ensure that the client has the correct permissions. Monitor the logs for the same error message - this will point to the time-range in which the permissions changed, and enable a remedy to be constructed and applied.</p>

<ul>
<li>Problem: Commands executed before or after a backup don't run</li>
<li>Description: Comet client is installed with the minimum permissions required to perform a backup, and little more. It is unlikely that the client software will have all the permissions to stop or start many processes or services.</li>
<li>Possible causes and solutions: 
<ol>
<li>the command may be located in a directory to which the Comet client cannot access. Place the batch file in a directory which can be accessed by the client software. Check that the command also has permission to execute the instructions contained in the batch file.</li>
<li>use services.msc to change the backup.delegate service to &quot;log on as&quot; LOCAL SYSTEM; or</li>
<li>grant additional permissions to the NT SERVICE\backup.delegate user account. In fact each running Windows service has a full ACL set. A good overview is here: <a href="http://woshub.com/set-permissions-on-windows-service/">http://woshub.com/set-permissions-on-windows-service/</a></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>A cautionary note: </p>
<ul>
<li>Granting too many, or unwarranted, privileges to Comet client is not recommended. Care should be taken to ensure that only the bare minimum extra permissions are granted. Granting extra privileges should not be the default go-to solution.</li>

<ul>
<li>Problem: Server log shows message &quot;Bucket XXXX...: Couldn't look up properties of locks/YYYY.... because: The specified key does not exist.&quot;</li>
<li>Description: Comet has found a reference to a lockfile in the list of lockfiles, but when attempting to read that lockfile, the lockfile no-longer exists. </li>
<li>Cause: The normal sequence is that a backup job will complete, remove its lockfile, then immediately remove the lockfile from the list of lockfiles. Where there is high-volume usage of the vault, or multiple simultaneous backup jobs, it is possible for a backup job to read the list of lockfiles, and then to try to read all the lockfiles for their details, but find that a lockfile from the list has already been deleted in the split-second between reading the list and attempting to read the lockfiles. The backup job may hang while waiting to find the expected file.</li>
<li>Immediate Solution: 
<ul>
<li>Stop the backup jobs &amp; restart them. This will reset the list of lockfiles.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Long-term solution: 
<ul>
<li>Stagger the schedule of backup jobs</li>
<li>Have fewer jobs into the same vault</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>Normally, this is a warning only.</li>
<li>The backup can time-out if waiting for the storage location to count-up and supply the size of the Storage Vault. </li>
<li>If the storage is a TrueNAS, and the Comet Server is Linux, then the following trick may assist greatly:
<ul>
<li>Mount the TrueNAS storage to the Comet Server via CIFS/SMB</li>
<li>Change Comet Server to use a Local Folder for the storage
The size-determination should now be near-instantaneous.</li>

<ul>
<li>Affects: Windows OS devices such as laptops, which can be switched-off or placed into 'sleep' or suspension mode arbitrarily.</li>
<li>Cause: 
<ul>
<li>Missed backup jobs are those which do not start at the scheduled time, */- 10 minutes.</li>
<li>If the device is a laptop which has had its lid closed or similar, the Windows OS <em>suspends</em> all processes so that, when 'woken up', they resume as though nothing had happened.</li>
<li>If a scheduled backup for a suspended device does not start, the lack of a start will cause a 'Missed' log entry to be placed. When the laptop <em>wakes</em>, however, it is not <em>starting</em>, it is only <em>resuming</em>, so the backup option <code>When PC Starts, if last job was Missed</code> may not get triggered.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Solution:
<ul>
<li>reschedule the backup for a time when the device is awake and online, or </li>
<li>leave the device on and awake, where possible, or to 'lock' the device only, or</li>
<li>acknowledge that a 'sleep' is not a shut-down, and the <code>When PC Starts, if last job was Missed</code> option won't currently trigger where there is not a startup. </li>

<ul>
<li>Affects: All devices, all OS's.</li>
<li>Causes:
<ul>
<li>The device clock has drifted ahead or behind its time-zone by more than 10 minutes. This is a common thing to gradually happen to devices which do not sync their internal clock with an internet time-service.</li>
<li>Missed backup jobs are those which do not start at the scheduled time, */- 10 minutes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Effect:
<ul>
<li>The Comet Server has recorded the 'Missed' backup event, and the backup which started at a later (or earlier) time.</li>
<li>A backup schedule has been misconfigured to have simultaneous backups for the same Protected Item</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Solution: 
<ul>
<li>Ensure the Comet Server is in sync with its internet time-zone</li>
<li>Ensure the device is in sync with its internet time-zone</li>
<li>Ensure the user-profile <code>Timezone</code> is selected correctly.</li>

<ul>
<li>Affects: USB storage locations</li>
<li>Cause: 
<ul>
<li>The <code>sync</code> function is an operation which ensures that data has been fully written onto a disk. </li>
<li>It is not uncommon for some storage types, especially USB sticks, to report 'finished' or 'completed' when in fact they are still writing, with the data unwritten but on-hand, buffered somewhere. Comet will normally run a <code>sync</code> process to check whether the writing has properly completed, and it should print any warnings and messages about it.</li>
<li>If the storage location is a special kind of drive (perhaps NAS, network share, or flash drive) which doesn't support <code>sync</code>, you may see this message in the log.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Solution:
<ul>
<li>Change to a storage type which supports this function</li>

<p>Problem: An attempt to add a new Storage Vault, or perform a backup to a cloud storage location returns an error as above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The device shows as online, and can communicate with the Comet Server, but it fails when attempting to add a Storage Vault, or to perform a backup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cause: </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The device cannot communicate with the storage location, and/or the device clock is out of sync with Wasabi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Steps to resolve: </p>
<ul>
<li>Does this happen for all devices or just one? </li>
<li>Do you get the same result if you login to the client software with the user-profile username and password, but on a different device?</li>
<li>If isolated to a single device, use an S3-Compatible client, such as CyberDuck, to verify that you can view/list the storage bucket manually?
<ul>
<li>This will indicate whether the issue is likely in the device, or in the network.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Is the LAN environment a restricted one? Typically, schools and corporate offices have highly restricted and controlled networks. Check that </li>
<li>Does the device have up-to-date SSL root-certificate lists? The device may be rejecting a secure connection if its certificates are not up to date. Perform OS and security updates as needed.</li>
<li>Check the device for clock drift. Sync the device with internet time.</li>
